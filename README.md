###### This is a Re-draw of Shadow Price with significant structural and aesthetic improvements that I made over the summer of 2020. It is now to scale compared to Destiny and much easier for me to edit, so I can begin making all the other variants of stocks, barrels, and frames seen in the game. Internally, it is still BLDC flywheels and solenoid pusher, but now uses a sensorless ammo counter with a 16 bit display. It also uses lots of hardware and friction fits to hold the blaster toghether, unlike the original which was mostly glued together. As a result, most visual components are separate parts, so even without paint the blaster should look very nice with good filament colors, and allows for certian panels to be swapped on the fly, given that multiples were printed. 

### The STLs for all components are not inhenretly in the correct priting orientation, however there are large flat areas on all parts so use your best judgement when printing and print on these faces
